* TO EDIT : First I linked yacc and lex file with union, Now I can pass stuffs from lex to yacc. 
* Now, since I wanted to make a syntax tree after I read yacc file, 
    * Tokens come to yacc file
    * I have to make nodes out of tokens and make a syntax tree. 
    * We can see patterns in stack : I have to replace the patterns with 
    apppropriate objects. 
    * For that I have to create classes for operators and values, also I have to make
    enums for identifying them as variables / values / operators / whatever stuffs.
